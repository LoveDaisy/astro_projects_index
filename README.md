This is an index for astro tools developed by a group of amateur astronomers. We develop these tools for our interest.

## Projects

| project | owner | description | language |
|---------|-------|-------------|----------|
| [star alignment](https://github.com/LoveDaisy/star_alignment) | [LoveDaisy (章佳杰)](https://github.com/LoveDaisy) | Align several astronomy / nightscape images by star points and average them to reduce noise. Apply to wide angle lens as well as tele-lens. | python |
| [ice halo simulation](https://github.com/LoveDaisy/ice_halo_sim) | [LoveDaisy (章佳杰)](https://github.com/LoveDaisy) | A ray-tracing based simulation program for ice halos. | c++ |
| multi-frame denoising (TODO) | [LoveDaisy (章佳杰)](https://github.com/LoveDaisy) | Multi-frame denoising algorithm. Align small patches in each frame and do a robust averaging to reduce noise. Like RAW+ | c++ |
| intelligent shutter | 一思佛 | ... | ... |
| intelligent shutter | [KenLuozhenyu](https://github.com/kenluozhenyu) | Arduino machine, to control a camera's shuttel/ISO/other settings during an automation shooting script. The original intention is mainly for solar eclipse HDR propose. | ... |
| [Kepler data Machine Learning](https://github.com/kenluozhenyu/kepler_cnn_in_keras) | [KenLuozhenyu](https://github.com/kenluozhenyu) | Rewrite the "astronet" project code in Keras framework | Python |
| auto focusing (TODO) | ... | Auto focusing during an eclipse. | ... |
| eclipse corona enhancer (TODO) | ... | Merge eclipse images taken with different exposures and enhance details of corona. Like [this](https://hdr-astrophotography.com/?from=singlemessage&isappinstalled=0) | ... |
